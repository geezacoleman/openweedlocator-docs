## Step 1: Prepare Your Raspberry Pi

### Option A: Quick Software Installation (Recommended)

1. **Flash Raspberry Pi OS** (64-bit) to SD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
   - Set username to `owl` during setup
   - Enable SSH and WiFi if needed

2. **Two-line installation** after first boot:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/geezacoleman/OpenWeedLocator owl
   bash owl/owl_setup.sh
   ```

   This automatically installs all dependencies and configures the system.

### Option B: Manual Installation

For detailed step-by-step installation, see our [complete software guide](../software/installation.md).

## Step 2: Choose Your Hardware Path

### Print Settings
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm (0.16mm for better quality)
- **Infill**: 25%
- **Supports**: Not required but improve quality
- **Material**: PLA or PETG

```{admonition} Alternative Options
:class: tip

Don't have a 3D printer? Download files from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/875853-raspberry-pi-rugged-imaging-enclosure) or use online printing services.
```

## Step 4: Assembly Overview

### Compact OWL Assembly

1. **Prepare Components**
   - Install heat-set inserts in 3D printed parts
   - Mount camera to tray with standoffs
   - Install Raspberry Pi on tray

2. **Electronics Assembly**
   - Connect OWL driver board or relay HAT
   - Wire Amphenol connector
   - Test connections

3. **Final Assembly**
   - Install tray in enclosure
   - Attach front and back plates
   - Add waterproofing seals

### Original OWL Assembly

1. **Component Mounting**
   - Mount all components to 3D printed mounts
   - Install in base enclosure

2. **Wiring**
   - Connect GPIO pins to relay board
   - Wire power system with voltage regulator
   - Add indicators and buzzer

3. **Testing & Sealing**

[Detailed assembly guides ‚Üí](../hardware/index.md)

## Step 5: Configuration & Testing

### Camera Focus

Run the focus utility to ensure sharp images:

```bash
~/owl/./owl.py --focus
```

Adjust the lens focus while watching the sharpness value on screen. Higher values = better focus.

### Test Detection

1. **Basic Test**:
   ```bash
   ~/owl/./owl.py --show-display
   ```

2. **Field Test**: Take your OWL outside and test with real vegetation

### Configuration

Edit the config file for your specific needs:

```bash
nano ~/owl/config/DAY_SENSITIVITY_2.ini
```

Key settings to adjust:
- Detection sensitivity
- Relay assignments  
- Camera resolution
- Actuation timing

## Step 6: Mounting & Deployment

### Vehicle Mounting

![Vehicle mounted OWL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51358498/130522810-bb19e6ca-5019-4de4-83cc-858eca358ef8.jpg)

- Mount at appropriate height for your application
- Ensure stable, vibration-resistant mounting
- Connect to 12V power supply
- Add solenoids/nozzles as needed

### Power Requirements

- **OWL Unit**: 12V, ~2A
- **Solenoids**: Varies by type (typically 1-3A each)
- **Total System**: Size fuse accordingly

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Issue | Quick Solution |
|-------|----------------|
| No beep on startup | Check camera connection, run `~/owl/./owl.py` for errors |
| Relays not activating | Verify 12V power connections and GPIO wiring |
| Poor detection | Adjust focus, check lighting conditions, tune sensitivity |
| SD card errors | Use high-quality SD card, check for corruption |

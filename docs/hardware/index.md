## Safety Guidelines

```{admonition} Important Safety Notes
:class: warning

‚ö†Ô∏è **Electrical Safety**
- Never make changes while connected to 12V power
- Always double-check connections before powering on
- Use appropriate fuses for your system
- Verify polarity before connecting power

‚ö†Ô∏è **Soldering Safety**  
- Use proper ventilation and safety equipment
- Allow components to cool before handling
- Use heat shrink tubing to prevent short circuits

‚ö†Ô∏è **Mounting Safety**
- Ensure secure mounting to prevent vibration damage
- Use appropriate hardware for your vehicle/platform
- Consider accessibility for maintenance
```

## Common Components

Both OWL variants share these core components:

### Computing Platform

| Component | Recommendation | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Raspberry Pi** | Pi 5 4GB (preferred) or Pi 4 | Pi 5 offers better performance for higher resolutions |
| **SD Card** | 64GB Class 10 or better | SanDisk Extreme recommended |
| **Camera** | Global Shutter Camera + 6mm lens | Best performance, especially at speed |

```{admonition} Camera Options
:class: note

**Recommended**: Raspberry Pi Global Shutter Camera
- Best performance at vehicle speeds
- Reduced motion blur
- Requires 6mm wide-angle lens

**Supported Alternatives**:
- Raspberry Pi HQ Camera (12MP) + lens
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3  
- Raspberry Pi V2 Camera (not recommended for field use)
```

### Power & Control

Both designs require 12V input power and relay control capabilities:

- **Input**: 12V DC (vehicle power or battery)
- **Pi Power**: 5V regulated (3-5A depending on Pi model)
- **Relay Control**: 4-channel capability for multiple actuators
- **Protection**: Fused input, proper grounding

## 3D Printing Guidelines

### Print Settings

All OWL enclosures are designed for standard FDM printing:

```{code-block} yaml
Layer Height: 0.2mm (0.16mm for better finish)
Infill: 25%
Supports: Not required (but improve surface finish)
Material: PLA or PETG
Nozzle Temp: 200-220¬∞C (PLA), 240-260¬∞C (PETG)
Bed Temp: 60¬∞C (PLA), 80¬∞C (PETG)
```

### Post-Processing

1. **Remove supports** if used
2. **Install heat-set inserts** where required
3. **Test fit components** before final assembly
4. **Deburr holes** and clean surfaces

### File Downloads

All STL files are available in the main repository:

## Assembly Process Overview

### 1. Component Preparation

- **3D print** all required parts
- **Install heat-set inserts** in printed components  
- **Prepare electronics** - test components before assembly
- **Organize hardware** - sort screws, standoffs, etc.

### 2. Electronics Assembly

- **Mount computing components** to appropriate mounts/tray
- **Connect power system** - voltage regulation and distribution
- **Wire relay control** - GPIO connections and relay board
- **Add indicators** - LEDs, buzzer for status feedback

### 3. System Integration

- **Install in enclosure** - mount assembled components
- **Connect external interfaces** - power, solenoid connections
- **Seal enclosure** - weather protection measures
- **Final testing** - verify all functions before deployment

### 4. Calibration & Setup

- **Camera focus** - critical for detection performance
- **Software configuration** - detection parameters
- **Field testing** - verify performance in actual conditions

## Official OWL Hardware

```{admonition} Official Components Available
:class: tip

**OWL Driver Board v2.1**
- Combines relay control, power management, and wiring
- Simpler assembly than discrete components
- More robust performance
- Available for purchase (details TBD)

**Official Enclosure**  
- Extruded aluminum construction
- Improved durability and weather resistance
- Glass lens window
- Production-ready design
```

## Connecting Actuators

### Solenoid Connections

Both OWL designs can control up to 4 solenoids (12V):

**Common Connection Pattern**:
- Relay 1-4: Individual solenoid control lines
- Common Ground: Shared between all solenoids and power supply
- 12V Supply: Fused connection to vehicle power

## Troubleshooting Hardware Issues

### Common Problems

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **No power LEDs** | Power supply issue | Check fuse, connections, voltage regulator |
| **Pi starts but no beep** | Software/camera issue | Check camera cable, review software logs |
| **Relays clicking but no actuation** | Solenoid power issue | Verify 12V to solenoids, check connections |
| **Intermittent operation** | Loose connections | Review all wire connections, especially GPIO |

### Testing Procedure

1. **Visual Inspection**: Check all connections match wiring diagram
2. **Power Test**: Verify correct voltages at key points  
3. **Component Test**: Test each relay/solenoid individually
4. **Software Test**: Run OWL with display to verify detection
5. **Integration Test**: Full system test with real vegetation
